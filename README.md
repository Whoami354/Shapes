# JavaFX Polygon Interaction
This project is a JavaFX application developed during my Computer Science studies.

The application displays multiple polygons on the screen and allows interactive manipulation of these shapes. Polygons can be moved individually or moved together as a group, enabling different ways of interaction.

When a polygon is double-clicked, it changes its color to black, providing visual feedback for user interaction. Additionally, the application ensures that all polygons always remain inside the application window, regardless of how strongly the user tries to move them outside the visible area. This boundary handling is an important part of the implementation.

The project focuses on practicing JavaFX concepts such as event handling, shape manipulation, coordinate calculations, and enforcing layout constraints.
